I am creating a classification prediction model to detect the damages caused by bird strike in the United States. The dataset is taken from the FAA Website and set fro 4 years. The Data set is from 1st May 2018 to 1st May 2021.
# The source of the data is https://wildlife.faa.gov/search, do choose the date as 2018, 1st May to 2021 1st, May. The Model  can be replicated with any date.
